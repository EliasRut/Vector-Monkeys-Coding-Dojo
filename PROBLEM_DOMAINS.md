# Problem domains
Not everyone is interested in the same things. But to enjoy spending time with programming examples, a certain fascination helps a __lot__.
We try to engage people as best as we can by providing multiple domains for challenges and examples. You can think about these in the sense of scenarios or settings.

All such domains will have a set of exercise to them, and these should cover approximately the same topics. They are only different in their story telling and their specifics.

Going through and completing all exercises for one domain should always be enough to cover all the basics. Going through multiple should help deepening the understanding
and provide the benefits of repetition.

## Domain overview
What follows is a brief explanation of the domains we came up with.

### Star Ranger
You are the lonely hero of a sci-fi space exploration mission, finding yourself stuck with malfunctioning software.
By solving the challenges, your make your ship space ready again.

### WesterOS
Your programming describes the laws and contents of a mystical fantasy realm. By solving the challenges, you help a story come together.

### Business Inc.
The world of business needs your help to get those spreadsheets filled and the reports sent out. You write your code to integrate information
and finally get a report of the current state of the business out of the system.

## Covered programming topics
Each domain should cover the following topics, in approximately the same order:

* Simple value types (strings, booleans, integers, floats)
* Return values
* Variables and constants
* Operations on variables
* Functions
* Conditional expressions
* For loops
* Lists/Arrays
* Objects
* Classes
* Exception handling
* Asynchronous methods and callbacks
* Promises
* Inheritance

## Domain structure
Every domain starts with an introduction text that establishes the scenario. This text covers what role the person writing the code has, 
how they came into that position, and what the final goal of the challenges is. 

Following that we have a listing of the steps that need to be completed, and how they fit into the domain narrative.

After that should be the exercises, structured into manageable and easy-to-find chunks - best would be named by the topics they cover, but a domain-specific
title is also okay. Important is that people who want to read up on a specific topic have an easy time of finding the examples for it.

The first set of exerices should be to get the setup for the domain done, and what the expected output of an empty, running test set is.

### Remarks
While domains should be intended to be done from start to finish, they should also work for just repeating specific topics without too much work on the side of
the student. Setups that strongly require that every lesson is done in order, without an option to skip to a certain point, are discouraged.

Keep in mind that exercises are intended to be solved in-editor. Linking to websites etc is fine and encouraged, but all progress should be easily saved in-editor
and commitable via git.

Finally, any steps to make the process more real-world are encouraged, like creating git merge conflicts on specific parts, or asking for regular commits etc.
